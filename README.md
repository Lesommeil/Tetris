# Tetris


this is my first game I'm making, there still have many problem, and many thing is undone.
undone:
the code need be clear, ui, T-spin(I don't even know how to perform it), some game mode...
problem:
spin will push back, will have a little stuck.
random number isn't doing well.

I guess I will write something to describe the code, but not right now, even myself need try to understand what the past me is doing.


I guess many people want read source code to saw how other people is doing, if anyone notice this, and want to know something, I really hope you can answer it, if I noticed it I will answer, however it maybe need month. and sorry about stupid code, guess I will fix it.
